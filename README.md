# LibraryReservations

An attempt to automate library reservations at geisel library using puppeteer. 
Done at the insistence of Nick De Mello :)

## Version history:

### v1.0.0
Attempt using cypress. Ran into problems with cross origin frames

### v1.1.0
Attempt using puppeteer. As of now it can reserve one room for one hour 2 weeks from today. The room and hour must be passed in manually meaning it is not yet ready. 

## Planned:

### v1.2.0
Programatically look for open space in my favorite rooms then default to any open space.

### v1.3.0
Integrate with github workflows

### v1.3.1
Integrate with github secrets
